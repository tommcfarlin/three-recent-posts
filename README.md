# Three Recent Posts

This plugin displays the three most recent posts published on your blog in a meta box on the post
editor screen.

## About This Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to demonstrate how to take an idea of a plugin from the standpoint of
[rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) to a well-design plugin.

## How It Works

1. Upon activation, the plugin will add a meta box to the standard post editor screen.
